After providing a strong foundation of the underlying theory and concepts, the course relied heavily on hand-on exercises and tutorials in order for the participants to directly apply and practice on methods and techniques presented throughout each day.</p>\n<p>The material is organized into five days / modules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Experimental Design and Statistics</li>\n<li>Introduction to basic NGS pipelines</li>\n<li>Machine Learning and Data Mining in Bioinformatics</li>\n<li>Introduction to epigenomics</li>\n<li>Metagenomics and Correlation in Life Sciences</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All content has been designed to work with the <a href=\"https://readthedocs.org/\">readthedocs</a> platform, with the rendered site being available <a href=\"https://codata-rda-advanced-bioinformatics-2018.readthedocs.io\">here</a>.</p>",
